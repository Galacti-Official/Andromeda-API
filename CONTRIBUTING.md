# Contributing

Welcome to Galacti's **Andromeda API** repository! Anyone here is welcome to request/suggest new features and improvements, report bugs and errors, and especially to help improve the API itself by contributing useful code changes or improvements, building upon already existing features or adding new ones, or fulfilling existing feature requests by closing their relevant issues.



## Reporting bugs

When reporting a bug:
- Create a bug report issue.
- Use the **Bug Report** issue template.
- Provide clear reproduction steps.
- Include relevant logs or tracebacks.
- Make sure to specify environment details.

## Requesting/suggesting features

When requesting or suggesting new features:
- Create a feature request issue.

## Working on issues

If you'd like to work on an issue:
- Comment on the issue and state your intention.
- Clone the repository locally and create a new branch following our naming conventions:

```

- Make sure that the branch has been added to the issue.
- When the issue has been solved, create a related **pull request**.

## Creating a pull request

Before submitting a PR:
- Use the provided PR template.
- Link the relevant issue like this:

```

All PRs should:
- Pass tests
- Follow the previously used code style
- Include tests for new funtionallity
- Update documentation if needed
- Update the **changelog** if user-visible changes are made

PRs may be requested to revise before merging.
